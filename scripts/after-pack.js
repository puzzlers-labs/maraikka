/*
Electron Builder After-Pack Hook Script

This script runs automatically after Electron Builder packages the Maraikka app but before final
distribution. It creates macOS Services installation infrastructure that allows users to access
encryption/decryption functionality directly from Finder's context menu.

Purpose:
- Generates user-friendly installation scripts for macOS Services integration
- Dynamically updates workflow files to reference the actual installed app path
- Creates both embedded and standalone installers for flexible deployment
- Ensures seamless integration between Maraikka app and macOS Services system

Dependencies:
- fs-extra: Enhanced file system operations for copying and writing files
- path: Node.js path manipulation utilities
- Electron Builder context: Provides build information and output paths

Build Integration:
This file is automatically executed by Electron Builder's afterpack hook during the build process.
It only runs for macOS builds (darwin platform) and is skipped for other platforms.

Generated Output:
- App bundle installer: [AppName].app/Contents/Resources/install-macos-services.sh
- Standalone installer: Install macOS Services.command (placed in distribution directory)
- Both installers handle dynamic path resolution and workflow file updates
