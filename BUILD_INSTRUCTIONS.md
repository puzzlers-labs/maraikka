# Maraikka Build & Installation Instructions

## üöÄ Building the App

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- macOS (for building macOS version)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for macOS (creates universal binary)
npm run build-mac

# Build for Windows
npm run build-win

# Build for Linux
npm run build-linux

# Build for all platforms
npm run build
```

### Build Output

After building, you'll find these files in the `dist/` directory:

- **`Maraikka-1.0.0-universal.dmg`** - Main macOS installer
- **`Install macOS Services.command`** - Context menu services installer
- **`mac-universal/Maraikka.app`** - The built application bundle

## üì¶ Installing the App

### Step 1: Install the Application

1. **Open the DMG**: Double-click `Maraikka-1.0.0-universal.dmg`
2. **Drag to Applications**: Drag `Maraikka.app` to the `/Applications/` folder
3. **First Launch**: Right-click the app and select "Open" (to bypass Gatekeeper)

### Step 2: Install Context Menu Services (macOS Only)

**Option A - From DMG:**
1. In the mounted DMG, double-click **`Install macOS Services.command`**
2. Enter your password if prompted
3. The services will be automatically installed

**Option B - From Installed App:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `/Applications/Maraikka.app/Contents/Resources/install-macos-services.sh`

**Option C - Manual Installation (Development):**
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run: `cd macos-services && ./install-services.sh`

## üñ±Ô∏è Using Context Menu Services

After installation, you can:

1. **Right-click** any file or folder in Finder
2. Look for **"Encrypt with Maraikka"** or **"Decrypt with Maraikka"** in the Services menu
3. **Enter your password** in the dialog that appears
4. The file will be encrypted/decrypted in place

### If Services Don't Appear

## üîß Development

```

This will set up the services to work with the development version of the app.
