# Development macOS Services Installer
#
# This script installs Maraikka's macOS Services integration for development environments.
# It enables "Encrypt with Maraikka" and "Decrypt with Maraikka" context menu options
# in Finder, configured to work with the development build using electron commands.
#
# Purpose:
# - Copies workflow files from project to ~/Library/Services/
# - Updates AppleScript to use development commands (electron . --encrypt/decrypt)
# - Enables testing of Services integration during development
# - Provides contributor-friendly Services installation
#
# Differences from Production:
# - Uses "cd project && electron ." instead of "open -a /Applications/Maraikka.app"
# - Targets development workflow testing vs end-user distribution
# - Requires project setup (npm install, electron available)
# - Manual execution vs automated build integration
#
# Dependencies:
# - Python 3 for plist manipulation
# - Project must be properly set up with dependencies installed
# - macOS Services system for workflow registration
# - Electron executable available in PATH or node_modules
#
# Usage:
# Run from project root or scripts directory: ./scripts/install-macos-services.sh
# Services will appear in Finder context menus after installation
