# File Encryption

Learn how to securely encrypt your files and directories using Maraikka's powerful AES encryption system.

## Overview

Maraikka offers two main encryption methods:
- **Single File Encryption**: Encrypt individual files with unique passwords
- **Directory Encryption**: Encrypt all files in a directory with one password

Both methods use military-grade AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption to protect your data.

## Single File Encryption

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Select Your Directory
First, navigate to the directory containing the file you want to encrypt:

1. Click **"Select Directory"** in the sidebar
2. Choose the folder containing your target file
3. The file list will display all contents

#### 2. Locate Your File
Find the file you want to encrypt in the file list. You can:
- **Scroll through the list** to find your file
- **Use the search function** (if available)
- **Switch to grid view** for visual file identification

#### 3. Initiate Encryption

1. **Hover over the target file**
2. **Click the "Encrypt" button** that appears
3. The password modal will open

#### 4. Set Your Password

1. **Enter a strong password** in the password field
2. **Check the password strength meter**:
   - üî¥ **Weak**: Increase password complexity
   - üü° **Fair**: Consider adding more characters
   - üü¢ **Good**: Acceptable security level
   - üü¢ **Excellent**: Optimal security
3. **Click "Confirm"** to proceed

#### 5. Encryption Process
- Maraikka will display a progress indicator
- The original file is converted to Base64 for binary safety
- AES encryption is applied using your password
- The original file is securely deleted
- A new `.enc` file is created

#### 6. Verify Encryption
After encryption completes:
- The file now has a `.enc` extension
- A lock icon appears next to the filename
- File statistics update to show one more encrypted file

### Password Guidelines

#### Strong Password Requirements
- **Minimum length**: 6 characters (12+ recommended)
- **Character variety**: Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Avoid common patterns**: No dictionary words or personal info
- **Unique passwords**: Use different passwords for different files

#### Password Examples
```
‚ùå Weak: password123
‚ùå Weak: myname1990
‚úÖ Strong: Tr0ub4dor&3
‚úÖ Strong: M@raikka2024!Secure
‚úÖ Excellent: K7#mN9$pQ2@vX8&wZ5
```

## Directory Encryption

### When to Use Directory Encryption
- **Multiple related files**: Documents in a project folder
- **Consistent security level**: All files need same protection
- **Simplified management**: One password for entire directory
- **Batch processing**: Faster than individual file encryption

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Select Target Directory
1. Click **"Select Directory"** in the sidebar
2. Choose the directory you want to encrypt
3. Review the file list to ensure it contains the correct files

> [!WARNING]
> **Directory encryption affects ALL files** in the selected directory. Make sure you want to encrypt everything.

#### 2. Initiate Directory Encryption

1. **Click "Encrypt Directory"** in the sidebar
2. The directory encryption modal opens
3. Review the file count and directory path

#### 3. Set Directory Password
1. **Enter a strong password** for the entire directory
2. **Verify password strength** using the built-in meter
3. **Remember this password** - you'll need it to decrypt any file
4. **Click "Confirm"** to start encryption

#### 4. Monitor Progress

- **Progress bar** shows overall completion
- **Current file** being encrypted is displayed
- **File count** updates as files are processed
- **Cancel option** available if needed (not recommended)

#### 5. Completion
When directory encryption finishes:
- All files now have `.enc` extensions
- Lock icons appear on all encrypted files
- File statistics show the updated encrypted count
- Success notification appears

### Directory Encryption Best Practices

#### Before Encryption
- **Backup important files** to a separate location
- **Close any open files** in the directory
- **Ensure sufficient disk space** for the encryption process
- **Test with a small directory** first if you're new to Maraikka

#### During Encryption
- **Don't interrupt the process** - let it complete fully
- **Avoid using other applications** heavily during encryption
- **Keep your computer plugged in** for large directories

#### After Encryption
- **Test decryption** on one file to verify the password works
- **Store the password securely** in a password manager
- **Document what was encrypted** for future reference

## Advanced Encryption Options

### Hardware Authentication (Premium)
> [!NOTE]
> **Premium Feature**: Requires a valid license key.

Instead of passwords, use hardware authentication:
- **YubiKey**: Physical security keys
- **Touch ID**: macOS biometric authentication
- **Windows Hello**: Windows biometric authentication
- **FIDO2 devices**: Any compatible authenticator

#### Setting Up Hardware Auth
1. **Open Preferences** ‚Üí Security tab
2. **Click "Register Authenticator"**
3. **Follow the setup wizard**
4. **Test authentication** with a sample file

### Bulk Operations (Premium)
> [!NOTE]
> **Premium Feature**: Requires a valid license key.

Encrypt multiple directories or file sets simultaneously:
- **Select multiple directories** for batch encryption
- **Queue encryption jobs** for processing
- **Monitor progress** across all operations
- **Pause and resume** bulk operations

## Encryption Technical Details

### AES Encryption Specifications
- **Algorithm**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Key derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- **Encryption mode**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- **Key length**: 256-bit keys
- **Salt**: Random salt for each file

### File Processing
1. **File reading**: Original file is read into memory
2. **Base64 encoding**: Binary files are encoded for safety
3. **Encryption**: AES encryption applied with user password
4. **File writing**: Encrypted data written to `.enc` file
5. **Secure deletion**: Original file is securely overwritten

### Security Guarantees
- **No password storage**: Passwords never saved to disk
- **Local processing**: All encryption happens on your device
- **Secure random**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Memory clearing**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

## Troubleshooting Encryption

### Common Issues

#### "Encryption Failed" Error
**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient disk space
- File is currently open in another application
- Permission issues with the file or directory

**Solutions:**
1. **Free up disk space** - ensure at least 2x file size available
2. **Close the file** in other applications
3. **Check file permissions** - ensure you can write to the directory
4. **Try encrypting as administrator** (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)

#### "Password Too Weak" Warning
**Solution:**
- **Increase password length** to at least 12 characters
- **Add variety**: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Avoid patterns**: Don't use dictionary words or personal information

#### Slow Encryption Performance
**Optimization tips:**
1. **Close other applications** to free up system resources
2. **Encrypt smaller batches** instead of very large directories
3. **Use an SSD** if possible for faster disk I/O
4. **Ensure adequate RAM** for large file processing
