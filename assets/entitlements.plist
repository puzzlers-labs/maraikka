macOS Entitlements Configuration

This file defines security permissions (entitlements) for the app on macOS.
These entitlements are required for proper app functionality and distribution through
Apple's code signing and notarization processes.

Important: These entitlements are applied when the app is code-signed for distribution.
Changes to this file require rebuilding and re-signing the app.
