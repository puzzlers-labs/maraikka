# Security Guide

Maraikka is designed with security as the top priority. This guide covers security best practices, technical details, and recommendations for protecting your sensitive data.

## Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

#### 1. **Local Processing Only**
- All encryption and decryption happens on your device
- No data is ever transmitted to external servers
- Your files never leave your computer during processing
- Complete offline functionality

#### 2. **Zero Password Storage**
- Passwords are never saved to disk or memory permanently
- Passwords are cleared from memory immediately after use
- No password recovery mechanism (by design)
- No password hints or storage

#### 3. **Military-Grade Encryption**
- AES-256 encryption in CBC mode
- PBKDF2 key derivation with SHA-256
- Cryptographically secure random number generation
- Industry-standard security practices

#### 4. **Secure Memory Management**
- Sensitive data is cleared from memory after use
- No swap file exposure of encryption keys
- Protected memory allocation where possible
- Secure deletion of temporary files

## Encryption Technical Details

### AES Encryption Specifications

#### Algorithm Details
- **Cipher**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **Mode**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- **Padding**: PKCS#7 padding
- **IV**: Random 16-byte initialization vector per file

#### Key Derivation
```
Key = PBKDF2(password, salt, iterations, keyLength)
- Hash Function: SHA-256
- Salt: 32 random bytes per file
- Iterations: 100,000 (configurable)
- Key Length: 256 bits (32 bytes)
```

#### File Format Structure
```
Encrypted File (.enc):
[Salt: 32 bytes] + [IV: 16 bytes] + [Encrypted Data: Variable]
```

### Security Guarantees

#### What Maraikka Protects Against
‚úÖ **Unauthorized file access**
‚úÖ **Data theft from storage**
‚úÖ **Accidental data exposure**
‚úÖ **Brute force attacks** (with strong passwords)
‚úÖ **Dictionary attacks**
‚úÖ **Rainbow table attacks**
‚úÖ **File system forensics**

#### What Maraikka Cannot Protect Against
‚ùå **Weak passwords** chosen by users
‚ùå **Keyloggers** capturing passwords during entry
‚ùå **Screen recording** of password entry
‚ùå **Physical access** to unlocked devices
‚ùå **Malware** with system-level access
‚ùå **Social engineering** attacks

## Password Security

### Strong Password Guidelines

#### Minimum Requirements
- **Length**: At least 12 characters (6 minimum enforced)
- **Complexity**: Mix of character types
- **Uniqueness**: Different passwords for different file sets
- **Unpredictability**: Avoid patterns and personal information

#### Password Strength Levels

| Level | Requirements | Security |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| üî¥ **Weak** | < 8 chars, common patterns | Vulnerable to attacks |
| üü° **Fair** | 8-11 chars, basic variety | Basic protection |
| üü¢ **Good** | 12+ chars, good variety | Strong protection |
| üü¢ **Excellent** | 16+ chars, high entropy | Maximum security |

#### Password Examples
```bash
# Weak passwords (avoid these)
‚ùå password123
‚ùå myname1990
‚ùå qwerty
‚ùå 123456789

# Strong passwords (recommended)
‚úÖ Tr0ub4dor&3
‚úÖ M@raikka2024!Secure
‚úÖ K7#mN9$pQ2@vX8&wZ5
‚úÖ correct-horse-battery-staple-2024!
```

### Password Management Best Practices

#### Use a Password Manager
**Recommended password managers:**
- **1Password**: Cross-platform, secure sharing
- **Bitwarden**: Open source, affordable
- **LastPass**: Popular, feature-rich
- **KeePass**: Local storage, highly secure

#### Password Generation
```bash
# Generate strong passwords using tools:
openssl rand -base64 32
pwgen -s 20 1
# Or use your password manager's generator
```

#### Password Storage
- **DO**: Store in a reputable password manager
- **DO**: Write down and store in a physical safe
- **DON'T**: Store in plain text files
- **DON'T**: Use browser password storage for critical passwords
- **DON'T**: Share passwords via email or messaging

## Hardware Authentication (Premium)

> [!NOTE]
> **Premium Feature**: Requires a valid license key.

### FIDO2/WebAuthn Security

#### Supported Authenticators
- **YubiKey Series**: YubiKey 5, YubiKey Bio
- **Touch ID**: macOS biometric authentication
- **Windows Hello**: Windows biometric authentication
- **Platform Authenticators**: Built-in device security

#### Security Benefits
- **Phishing Resistant**: Cannot be replicated or stolen
- **No Shared Secrets**: Private keys never leave the device
- **Cryptographic Proof**: Mathematical verification
- **User Presence**: Requires physical interaction

#### Setup Best Practices
1. **Register multiple authenticators** for backup
2. **Test authentication** before encrypting important files
3. **Keep backup authenticator** in secure location
4. **Document recovery process** for your organization

## File Security Best Practices

### Before Encryption

#### File Preparation
1. **Organize files** into logical groups
2. **Remove unnecessary files** to reduce attack surface
3. **Verify file integrity** before encryption
4. **Create backups** of critical files

#### Environment Security
- **Close unnecessary applications** during encryption
- **Ensure stable power supply** for large operations
- **Use secure, private networks** when possible
- **Disable cloud sync** temporarily during encryption

### During Encryption

#### Process Security
- **Don't interrupt encryption** once started
- **Monitor system resources** for unusual activity
- **Avoid using other applications** heavily
- **Keep the system secure** from physical access

#### Password Entry
- **Check for shoulder surfing** before entering passwords
- **Use secure input methods** when available
- **Verify password strength** before confirming
- **Clear clipboard** after password operations

### After Encryption

#### Verification
1. **Test decryption** on a sample file
2. **Verify file integrity** after decryption
3. **Confirm original files** are securely deleted
4. **Document encryption details** securely

#### Storage Security
- **Store encrypted files** in multiple locations
- **Use secure cloud storage** for backups
- **Implement access controls** on storage locations
