# Next.js Static Generation

With Next.js App Router, you can pre-render your pages using [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). Your pages will be generated at build time and statically served to visitors. It can also be cached by a CDN to maximize the performance.

This is supported by Nextra too. Here's an example using React Server Components:

export async function Stars() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra')
  const repo = await response.json()
  const stars = repo.stargazers_count
  return <strong>{stars}</strong>
}

<div className="p-4 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-900 rounded mt-6">
  Nextra has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!
</div>

The number above was generated at build time using React Server Components. The data is fetched during the build process and statically rendered.

Here's the MDX code for the example above:

```jsx
export async function Stars() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra')
  const repo = await response.json()
  const stars = repo.stargazers_count
  return <strong>{stars}</strong>
}

Nextra has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!
```

## Benefits of Static Generation

- **Performance**: Pages are pre-built and served from CDN
- **SEO**: Content is available immediately for search engines
- **Reliability**: No runtime dependencies for content rendering
- **Scalability**: Can handle high traffic with minimal server resources

## When to Use Static Generation

Static Generation is recommended for:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- Documentation sites
- Product listings
- Any content that doesn't change frequently

For dynamic content that changes on every request, consider using [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) with dynamic rendering.
